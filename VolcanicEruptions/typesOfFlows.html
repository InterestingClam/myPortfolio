            <h2>There are 4 different types of flow.</h2>
		    <h3>Pahoehoe lava flow, Aa lava flow, Blocky lava flow, and also Pillow lava flow.</h3>

			<p>Pahoehoe lava is more like foam, and the pahoehoe that forms when the lava cools is very "shelly"; so-called because walking on it is like walking on large egg shells.</p>
            <p>'A'ā (pronounced "ah-ah") is a Hawaiian term for lava flows that have a rough rubbly surface composed of broken lava blocks called clinkers.</p>
            <p>Block lava flows have surfaces that consist of large angular blocks of lava. Blocky lava flows usually have andesitic or basaltic-andesitic compositions and are more viscous than basaltic lava flows that form pāhoehoe or 'a'ā. The blocks in block lavas are smoother than the rough clinkery ones in 'a'ā.</p>
            <p>Pillow flows are produced by the piling up of individual pillow lava lobes. As a pillow flow forms, the newest pillows are erupted from the top of the stack and flow outward a limited distance before freezing, a process which tends to produce steep-sided mounds or ridges which can grow to be 10's of meters thick.</p>
