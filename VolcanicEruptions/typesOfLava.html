	<h1>Lava/Magma Types</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<article>
		    <p>(There are three basic types of magma/lava: basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic, each of which has a different mineral composition. All types of magma have a significant percentage of silicon dioxide.)</p>
			<h3>Basaltic: </h3>
                <p>More fluid than andesites, which contain more silica.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Andesitic: </h3>
                <p>Commonly erupts from stratovolcanoes as thick lava flows, some reaching several km in length!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Rhyolitic: </h3>
                <p>Viscous and tend to form thick blocky lava flows or steep-sided piles of lava called lava domes</p>
