				The greek godess Athena's representation and pet was an owl.
				Many tribes across the country not only believe that owls have a correlation to death, but also the afterlife. Tribes such as the Lakota, Omaha, Cheyenne, Fox, Ojibwa, Menominee, Cherokee, and Creek consider owls to be either an embodied spirit of the dead or associated with a spirit in some way.
				In the Middle East, the owl is linked with destruction, ruin and death. They are believed to represent the souls of people who have died un-avenged. Seeing an owl on the way to battle foretells a bloody battle with many deaths and casualties. 
				Seeing an owl at somebody's house predicts their death.
