				<li class="funFact">Owls can rotate their necks 270 degrees!</li>
				<li class="funFact">The eyes of an owl are not true “eyeballs.” Their tube-shaped eyes are completely immobile.</li>
				<li class="funFact">They have binocular vision which fully focuses on their prey and boosts depth perception.</li>
				<li class="funFact">Their disk shaped heads collect sound like a radar dish.</li>
				<li class="funFact">Many owl species have asymmetrical ears. When located at different heights on the owl's head, their ears are able to pinpoint the location of sounds in multiple dimensions</li>
				<li class="funFact">A group of owls is called a parliament.</li>
				<li class="funFact">Owls hunt other owls. Great Horned Owls are the top predator of the smaller Barred Owl.</li>
				<li class="funFact">Not all owls hoot! Barn Owls make hissing sounds, the Eastern Screech-Owl whinnies like a horse, and Saw-whet Owls sound like, well, an old whetstone sharpening a saw. Hence the name. </li>
				<li class="funFact">Owls are zygodactyl, which means their feet have two forward-facing toes and two backward-facing toes. Unlike most other zygodactyl birds, however, owls can pivot one of their back toes forward to help them grip and walk.</li>
