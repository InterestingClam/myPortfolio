		    <p>This image of Neptune and its rings and moons, captured by Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), shows compass arrows and a color key for reference.</p>
			<p>The north and east compass arrows show the orientation of the image on the sky. Note that the relationship between north and east on the sky (as seen from below) is flipped relative to direction arrows on a map of the ground (as seen from above).</p>
